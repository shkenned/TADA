# Idea and Research Question  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

We set out to understand the impact of lobbying on Congressional communication on Twitter. 

What can lobbying funds tell us about Congress members public rhetoric about key issues?

We will look specifically at two fields: the environment and gun control. 

*Hypothesis*: We expect that Congresspeople who receive more funds from lobbyists on bills they have sponsored related to gun control or the environemnt will tweet more often about these respective issues. Moreover, controlling for party, higher lobbying levels will also lead to more negatively/positively charged speech on these issues. 

We chose to work with data from the House of Representatives because they are typically more closely aligned with local interests and are more accountable to them (as they represent a smaller group of citizens) than Senators. 

# DATA  {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

## TWEETS {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

### *Twitter Data Acquisition*:
Using the Twitter API, we pulled 75,000 (25k/group member) Tweets from all 435 Members of the House of Representatives’ official accounts. We took a list of Congressmen from the 115th Congress (Jan 2017- Jan 2019). The tweets span from 205 to 2020, as some Congressmen have been in Congress pre-115th Congress and post 115th Congress. We keep these dates in mind throughout the analysis and focus on the 115th Congress (full list of members) but consider pre and post 115th congress data to see Congress members longer speech trends. 


We use this data as evidence of the political communication surrounding important issues for the Congress member and his audience, including on gun control and environmental legislation. We assume that there is an incentive for congress members to use Twitter communication to disseminated their views and political interests. 



## LOBBYING {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

### *Lobby Data Acquisition*:
Using data acquired from LobbyView.org, a group dedicated to “advancing data science research in interest group politics,” we were able to determine the amount of money received by congresspeople in 2019 and 2020 per bill that they sponsored. All examined bills were related to gun issues.  
To explore the influence of lobbying contributions on Twitter speech, we needed lobby monetary contribution data for 1) environment and gun legislation and for 2) individual members of Congress. 
LobbyView is an open-source website with lobby data for the United States. Their data spans the entire government. We focused on lobbying made to members of the House of Representatives (to match our Twitter data). The original data is sprad over 5 spreadsheets and we focused on gathering the relevant area and segmenting it in order to downsize files and have the specific data necessary for our study. 
<br>

The Lobby data is linked to bills sponsored in the House of Representatives and we link this money to Congressmen sponsors of the bill. This means that the monetary lobby contriution is not direct to the congress member but encompasses a lobby effort for the sponsored bill in question.
This link is sufficient since our hypothesis points to these lobbying contributions as influencers of debate on the house floor (sponsored bills) and Congress member's public rhetoric (Tweets). 

Our large lobby dataset contains dozens of variables that help us match data to twitter handles, Congressmen names, lobby firms, house bills, dates, etc.
For simplicity of our treatment study (effect of lobbying), we segmented this data into two sub-datasets. 
Both our 'gun' (df_money_gun_peryear) and 'environment' (df_money_env_peryear) lobbying sub-datasets contain the folowing variables:

- `report_year`: year of lobby contributions
- `congressman_twitter_handle`: Congressman handle for lobby recipient 
- `amount`(**treatment variable**): the percentage of voters from the total number of eligible registered voters for a given county
- `issue_code`: the presence of centralized vote center
<br>

### LOBBYING VISUALIZATION

From the two graphs below, we can see the variation of lobby contributions for sponsors of gun-related bills and sponsors of environemntal-related bills. The gun-related lobbying  for individual Congress members goes up to 25,000 dollars per year, while the environmental-related lobbying for individual Caongress members goes past a million dollars.

It is important to note thet in the environemntal-related lobbying chart below we have included various lobby areas that are linked in some way to the general idea of environment. We expect that most of these areas will have a negative speech effect, or abstinence of pro-environemnt speech, on Congressmen i.e. Chemicals, Fuels, Transport). Environment is the only variable that we expect to have a positive effect on speech pro-environment. Lastly, we expect Energy to be mixed and produce more conversation on the environment but on both negative and positive directions, due to the variance of energy groups across energy sources (some more environmentally-friendly than others).

# ANALYSIS

Representatives were grouped into three levels (low/medium/high) by how much total money they received from interest groups for all of the examined bills.
We examined the collocations of the word “gun” and created a dictionary that incorporated those phrases. The amount of documents per user name was 


We used (what function/process?)_____ to code each tweet along a scale from “Republican” to” Democrat,” under the assumption that Republicans are not supportive of firearm regulation and Democrats are. 
From this we compared the Representative’s level of funding from interest groups (on sponsored bills) to their tweets average negative-positive sentiment regarding firearms legislation.
